    <h2>The Horrendous Videos</h2>
    <p>The production quality of content in these 'courses' is shockingly bad. Please realise all the videos and quizzes are merely placeholders used to test development of the concept of 'Edu Duck'. I threw them together mostly in single takes, late at night. The YouTube videos are unlisted, URL access only, and will be deleted on next iteration of the platform.

    <h2>Edu Duck Name</h2>
    <p>Edu Duck is a working title. Alan came up with it in a discussion with me after approximately 90 seconds of analysis. As it happens, I quite like it now. OTOH it may or may not be appropriate.</p>

    <h2>Who Does What</h2>
    <p>Alan and Chris. I (Chris) had been mulling over the idea of online course delivery in my head for a few months. I brought it up with Alan on holiday and through a series of discussions, it seemed worth pursuing. I've been using Django to develop the platform. Alan is doing server config, providing Git repository, KanBanFlow planning tool,  and probably a development server behind http auth. Thinking aloud here, but a bug tracker would be useful too.</p>
