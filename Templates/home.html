            <p>We have a number of models where tutors and course designers can be paid for their work, or where we can host closed corporate programmes for a fee.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Free/Open* - Your course is open to all students free of charge. You don't get paid for creating or maintaining the course. You can get a slice of advertising revenues</li>
                <li>Paid - Students pay to enroll on your course. You set the fee. For your remuneration you will receive a reservation of the first Â£x of subscriptions followed by a percentage of all further subscriptions. See examples/try our calculator</li>
                <li>Closed - Your course is available only to your employees or staff. Your employees pay nothing. You pay a fee based on the number of students enrolling.</li>
            </ol>
