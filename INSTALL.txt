Thanks for trying EduDuck. To install and test it do as follows:

1. Clone the git repo, probably the master branch. (Perhaps I'll get 
more sophisticated with branching, but right now it's just the master)
If you downloaded the tarball, just unpack it someplace under your home
directory. Say /home/bob/eduduck

2. Install Python version >=2.5, but not version 3.x, http://www.python.org/

3. Install Django version >=1.4.x. https://www.djangoproject.com/download/.
Or you can git clone the django development repo.

git clone https://github.com/django/django.git

4. Edit eduduck/EduDuck/settings.py, modify the SITE_URL to point to the 
hostname or IP address of your workstation. Mine is called caicectus 
because that is what Magnus calls a cactus.

SITE_URL = 'http://caicectus:8000'

The rest of the settings constants should be deduced automatically from the
SITE_URL and SITE_ROOT. The latter of these two is determined
programmatically.

5. Run the development server. In terminal, navigate to the directory you just unpacked or cloned 
eduduck into:
    
cd /home/bob/eduduck
python manage.py runserver http://127.0.0.1:8000 

Use whatever IP address or hostname is sensible.

6. You should be good to go. Username chris has password chris.
